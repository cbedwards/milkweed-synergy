Cleaned data from Edwards' field work in 2016, putting ~5 clivicolis larvae on wild A. asclepiadis plants, and measuring their weight ~7 days later
Entries for larvae that survived

plantNum: identifier for individual plants (~5 larvae put on each plant)
weight: larvae weight at end of experiment
lgw: log of final larvae weight
trich: mean trichome density across the two transects - this is the measure to be used to represent trichomes
tough: mean of the two toughness measures
lat: latex measure at end of experiment
c.X: cardenolide measure from HPLC for peak at time X at beginning of experiment
date.in: day larvae were collected and weighed. Note: this varied between 7 and 8 days later depending on weather
dat.out: day larvae was placed out on plants
daysout: number days larvae was out. Note weather conditions caused this to be either 7 or 8 days
